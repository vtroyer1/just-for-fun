# tip-calculator

Hello there! This is my tip-calculator... a nice little fun project idea for an app. However, it is currently in python as that is the language I am starting my software journey with, and so I am perfecting my skills in it.

I am not sure how this will make it as a web app or mobile app... I assume I will remake it in JavaScript for web and then use node.js alongside React JS.
